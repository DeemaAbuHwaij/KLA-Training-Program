# Topic 2 Tasks

1. Download the Jenkinsfile from the Polybot project and review its structure.
2. Refactor the deploy stage into `vars/deploy.groovy` and document the function.
3. Add parameters to the pipeline (e.g., environment, branch, tags).
4. Run Jenkins builds with different parameter values.
5. Upload the shared library to GitHub for reuse.

## Deliverables
- Clean Jenkinsfile referencing the shared library
- `deploy.groovy` file inside `vars/` folder with documented logic
- README with instructions for using the shared library
