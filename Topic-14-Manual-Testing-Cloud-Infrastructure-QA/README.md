## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `test_cases.md` | Contains 10 test cases covering positive, boundary, and negative scenarios related to VPC creation and management |
| `bug_reports.md` | Documents 3 critical bugs related to DNS resolution, CIDR validation, and VPC creation with tags |
| `end_to_end_plan.md` | Describes a complete E2E test scenario for a 3-tier architecture including validation points |
| `api_scenarios.json` | JSON file defining various API test cases including POST, GET, DELETE and stress scenarios |

## Tools Used
- **Markdown** for test planning and bug reports
- **JSON** for structured API testing scenarios
- **Postman / Curl** (suggested) for API testing
- **Manual QA Techniques** for black-box validation

---

## Goals
- Practice structured manual QA for cloud systems
- Apply negative testing, boundary analysis, and scenario planning
- Test cloud APIs for both functionality and security

---

## Notes
- You can convert `test_cases.md` to Excel if needed.
- For actual implementation, integrate Postman or write Python test scripts using `requests`.
