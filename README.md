## 📘 About This Repository

Welcome! This repo contains **my personal journey** through the official DevOps and Cloud Engineering training program designed for new KLA employees who are graduates of the Fursa program.

Throughout this hands-on journey, I tackled real-world DevOps challenges using:
- 🚀 CI/CD tools like **Jenkins** and **Azure Pipelines**
- 🏗 Infrastructure-as-Code with **Terraform**, **Pulumi**, **Ansible**, and **Packer**
- 🐳 Docker (including Windows containers!)
- 💻 Bash scripting for system automation
- 🧪 QA methodologies for testing cloud infrastructure
- 🧵 Python multithreading and async
