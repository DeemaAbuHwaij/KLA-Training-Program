Product Workflow – Voyager® 1035

1. Sample Load & Alignment: The system loads a wafer and performs initial alignment for optimized scanning.

2. Laser Scanning: A laser beam rapidly scans the wafer surface to detect defects in real time.

3. Deep‑Learning AI: The DefectWise™ algorithm identifies and separates critical defects from pattern noise.

4. Visual Reporting: An interactive display shows a defect map with details like location, type, and severity.

5. Fab Integration: The results are sent to the MES system for real-time monitoring and trend analysis.

(MES is a software system used in factories to monitor, track, and manage the production process in real time).
