About KLA

KLA is a global tech company that builds tools to help make computer chips.
Their systems inspect and measure wafers to find tiny problems early in the production process.
They use optics, software, robotics, and machine learning to support every step of making chips.
The chips inside phones, cars, and laptops work better and are more reliable due to KLA.

Optical Inspection

KLA builds machines that use lasers and cameras to look for very small defects on wafers.
They scan the wafer surface and find issues that could affect the chip’s performance.
The system knows how to tell real problems from false alarms.
It learns over time and helps improve production results.
This inspection step is super important for chip quality.

Artificial Intelligence

KLA uses machine learning to detect problems that people or simple tools might miss.
The system checks lots of data and helps make smart decisions quickly.
It finds patterns, catches issues early, and helps predict future problems.
That makes the process more accurate and efficient.
AI in KLA is used as a tool to improve quality and speed.

Robotics

KLA also builds robots that move and scan wafers automatically.
These robots are fast and accurate, and they don’t make human mistakes.
They talk to other machines in the factory and keep things moving smoothly.
That helps reduce errors and saves time during chip production.
Robotics is key for full automation in modern fabs.
